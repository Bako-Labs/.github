# Top-tier web3 development for the Fuel Network ecosystem

Bringing a deep understanding of Fuel’s advanced architecture, we ensure the creation of robust, scalable, and secure core solutions, such as:

- [⛽️Fuel Connector:](https://github.com/Bako-Labs/fuel-connectors) the native wallet connector for all Fuel applications, enabling the use of external wallets from multiple networks to sign transactions on Fuel.
- [🔐Bako Safe:](https://github.com/Bako-Labs/bako-safe) the simplicity of a smart wallet with the unmatched safety of a multisig — all in one place. The native asset management solution designed for Fuel and beyond. The Bako Safe SDK manages all the logic of the Bako Safe multisig wallet, from within a dApp.
- [👤Bako ID:](https://github.com/Bako-Labs/bako-id) a native naming system across the Fuel ecosystem, enabling users to bridge their web2 handles to web3.
